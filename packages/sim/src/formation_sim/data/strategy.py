"""Extract each driver's *strategic* stint sequence from race laps.

Raw stint data is noisy: red-flag stoppages and late safety cars produce clusters of
near-free tyre changes (e.g. Monaco 2026 pits on laps 58,59,65,67,68) that are not
strategy. We merge sub-minimum stints into their neighbour and collapse consecutive
same-compound stints, recovering the intended compound sequence and pit laps. Shared by
the plausibility prior and the backtest so both see the same clean picture.
