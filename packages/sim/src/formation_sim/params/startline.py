"""Opening-lap position changes (the start "mixing" of the field).

Following the paper, each driver has an empirical distribution of positions
gained/lost on lap 1, smoothed with a Gaussian kernel so we can draw continuous
outcomes. Drivers with few observations fall back to the pooled field distribution.
