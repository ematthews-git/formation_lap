"""Strategy selection (independent policy).

The selection stage feeds a fan-facing page: it shows the ~5 strategies most likely to
actually be *run* at the race, not the single race-time optimum. With a fixed display
budget (the site has room for 5), the job is coverage of the plausible strategy space —
so this policy chooses the set that captures the most **plausibility mass** rather than
ranking near-identical optima.

Plausibility of a candidate ``q_i`` blends the historical prior (what gets run at this
circuit) with the driver-conditioned Monte-Carlo competitiveness (what is actually fast
from this grid slot). The 5 slots are then filled by a greedy submodular set-cover: each
pick adds the most plausibility mass not already represented, so distinct tyre-set /
stop-count strategies are preferred and near-clones are suppressed. The trade between
showing a second *ordering* of a likely set versus a fresh distinct strategy is decided
automatically per race by whether that alternate order genuinely carries mass.

Because selection is isolated, this policy can later become risk-averse, points-weighted
or team-oriented without touching generation or evaluation.
