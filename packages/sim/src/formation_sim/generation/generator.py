"""Candidate strategy generation.

Generation *proposes*, it does not *select*. It enumerates the entire rule-legal
candidate space (stop counts in the circuit's range, all compound sequences over the
weekend allocation satisfying the >=2-compound rule), computes each one's pit windows
from tyre economics, then **blends those windows toward the circuit's historically
observed windows** (capturing the undercut / real-world timing), and attaches a
historical plausibility prior. Nothing rule-legal is excluded. A competitiveness-based
``shortlist`` trims for Monte Carlo — pruning by analytic race time, not history.
